# Adaptive Particle Filter

Implementation of an adaptive Particle Filter for 2D-LiDAR localization.

The code of this work is part of a research work that will be presented at the [Design, Automation and Testing in Europe (DATE)](https://www.date-conference.com) conference, with the title

**Adaptive localization for autonomous racing vehicles with resource-constrained embedded platforms**

The paper is bein presented at the DATE24 conference, in Valencia, on March 25th, 2024.
